# Modified ABC Notation
A slight modification to the ABC Standard for musical notation.

For more information about the original ABC music notation, refer to [https://abcnotation.com](https://abcnotation.com)

## Demo
A widget demonstrating the modified ABC notation is available [here](https://paul-goodall.github.io/Modified_ABC_Notation/)

This widget makes use of the [ABCJS](https://www.abcjs.net) - an open source ABC music notation library, written by [Paul Rosen](https://github.com/paulrosen) and Gregory Dyke.
